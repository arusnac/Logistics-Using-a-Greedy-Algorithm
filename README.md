# Logistics-Using-a-Greedy-Algorithm

This is a simple application that takes a CSV of addresses and the distances between each address.

The algorithm takes a group of packages and sorts them to create the shortest path. This is done using a weighted graph.
It has a simple interface to show that each route/group of packages is delivered according to its specifications in another CSV file.
